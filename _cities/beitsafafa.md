## Background

Israeli citizenship, is separate from nationality, and exists in hierarchical structure. Citizenship is available to all Jewish Nationals, and also non-Jews who were present in Israel – not the West Bank or Gaza – in 1948. This ability to obtain Israeli citizenship is extended to the decedents of Palestinians in Israel, but should they wish to move out of Israel, they would lose their – and their decedents – eligibility for citizenship. Those who were forced to leave during the 1948 catastrophe, where Zionist militias expelled Arabs from their lands, are not eligible for Israeli citizenship. This affects most Palestinians who were present in what Israel defined as ‘enemy territory’, including the West Bank and Gaza, in 1948. Today, Palestinians who live within Israel’s borders and are known as Arab Israelis or Arab Israelis of Palestinian descent. In theory, these Palestinians have civil rights within Israel, and are subject to Israeli civil law. The reality is, Palestinian Israelis are not Jewish nationals, and therefore are systematically discriminated against. 

For all other Palestinians, they cannot obtain citizenship from Israel, or anywhere else for that matter. Palestinians who lived in the West Bank and Gaza prior to 1948 don’t have citizenship anywhere - despite the fact that they or their families have lived in their homes for hundreds of years - because Israel deemed that people present in these areas were in enemy territory in 1948. The West Bank and Gaza were under Jordanian and Egyptian military occupation from 1949 - 1967 respectively. Additionally, there are over 5.5 million Palestinian refugees living in forced exile - mostly in Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria - who have no citizenship anywhere; they were effectively rendered stateless through the creation of the Israel, and remain so 60 years later. 

Refugees are perhaps the most complex group of persons. Refugee camps exist in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. It is confusing that there are refugees in the West Bank and Gaza, areas that Israel would like to claim as of Judea and Samaria - thus part of biblical Israel - for the purpose of resources, land, settlements. Conversely, Israel considers the same area enemy territory for the purpose of refugees, citizenship, human rights, and the law. Ultimately, there are over 5 million people who prior to 1948 had homes, villages and land but since 1948 have been stuck in refugee camps. No Palestinian refugee is able to return to their family homes or land, whether that land is in the West Bank, Gaza, or 1948 territory (now Israel); Israel refuses the return of Palestinian refugees on the grounds of them lacking Jewish Nationality. 

Palestinians who lived in historic Palestine, and happened to live in cities now located in the West Bank (Bethlehem for instance) are not eligible for citizenship, or the associated protection and benefits associated with citizenship, in any state. They are not Israeli, Jordanian, or Egyptian citizens and the Palestine is considered an occupied territory thus cannot grant citizenship. Instead, Palestinians have Palestinian Authority identification and live under Israeli military law and occupation. On the other hand Jews living illegally in the West Bank – according to the UN High Court of Justice it is illegal for an occupier to move it’s citizens into territory they occupy - are Jewish nationals, Israeli citizens and are subject to Israeli civil law. 

Palestinian identification systems are complex and confusing. Identification is naturally a requirement for travel, and while many Palestinians can obtain travel documents it is an arduous process. West Bank Palestinians have their own ID, as do Jerusalemites, and both must travel aboard via Jordan because they aren’t permitted in Israel. Gaza has been under a siege and blockade for 10 years and virtually no one, let alone Palestinians, can enter or exit Gaza. Palestinians in 1948 territory, now known as Israel, can actually fly through Israel, with Israeli passports, as Israeli citizens.
