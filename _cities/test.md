synopsis: |
    Herbon is a Palestinian city, population ~ 250 000, located in the south of the West Bank. For years, decades in fact, it was the industrial engine of the region. The city is home to religiously significant sites including the tombs or sanctuaries of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah. Today, the city exists under difficult circumstances; it is a microcosm of the occupation. Freedom of movement in Hebron is extremely restricted, as soldiers control access through checkpoints and barriers, and settlers occupy the heart of the city.

### Background

Palestinians’ freedom of movement is restricted through a complex system of administrative measures (e.g. prohibited roads, permit requirements, age restrictions) and physical constraints (e.g. checkpoints, roadblocks, the Wall). Every day, in order to move anywhere beyond their immediate area of residence, Palestinians must pass through through checkpoints manned by Israeli soldiers, take significant detours because of roads that are closed to Palestinians or present ID cards and permits in order to get to work. The extent and pervasiveness of impediments to free movement is difficult to communicate, and perhaps harder to grasp as a concept because it is so foreign from anything one might experience in North America. To provide some frame of reference, there are more obstacles for a 10 year old girl walking to school in Hebron than there are for a middle aged man to entering a military base or boarding a plane in Canada. 

The system of movement restrictions that Israel has implemented discriminates against all Palestinians. Some Palestinians are almost certain to be denied permits or harrassed at checkpoints, but no Palestinian is guarenteed free and unimpeded movement. It does not matter whether it is the President of Palestine or a farmer trying to get to his field, every Palestinian is subject to Israel's system of restrictions. And nearly every journey involves interactions with Israeli soldiers and passing through checkpoints. Checkpoints and soldiers introduce uncertainty that make it very difficult to manage a schedule, and often becomes such an undertaking that Palestinians who can avoid travelling, do. 

There are many examples of medical staff and first responders who are held up at checkpoints while attempting to render assistance. Foreigners are also often prevented entry to Palestine by Israeli authorities (e.g. [UN Rapporteur for Israel](http://972mag.com/how-to-foil-a-human-rights-probe-keep-the-investigator-out/115600/), [Foreign Ministers](https://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=770681), [academics](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/noam-chomsky-denied-entry-into-israel-and-west-bank-1.290701), or [NGO and humanitarian workers](https://electronicintifada.net/content/why-does-israel-feel-threatened-humanitarian-workers/13192). 

The situation in Hebron is particularly harrowing. Hebron is a Palestinian city located in the south of the West Bank, and used to be the industrial engine of Palestine. In 1998, the Wye River memorandum was signed and Hebron was officially identified as unique. The supposedly temporary memorandum established conditions whereby Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers remain and occupy the city center. Today, freedom of movement in Hebron is extremely restricted, as soldiers, checkpoints, settlers, and barriers exist in the very heart of Hebron. Through an intricate system of military occupation, the city is broken down into H1 and H2 areas. A 100m walk in H1, from the market home [can take hours](9https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP4xS_7wLyM). [Entire streets are appropriated](https://www.hebronapartheid.org/index.php?page=map) by the Israeli military and areas are closed to only Palestinians. Even more disturbing is the fact that [Jewish settlers invade and occupy Palestinian](https://palsolidarity.org/2016/02/ongoing-colonization-in-hebron-israeli-forces-prepare-the-illegal-invasion-of-palestinian-houses-by-israeli-settlers/) homes under the protection of soldiers and [Palestinian children are harassed and beaten](pdf from assets) by Jewish Israeli settlers on the way to school. 

_Administrative system of control_ The foundation for the control of movement is the “permit system.” On May 14, 2002, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) announced that the “general exit permit” was cancelled and Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation would now require written Israeli permission to move between, and within, the occupied Palestinian territories. Under this system, virtually no one is permitted to enter or leave Gaza, less than 10% of Palestinians can leave the West Bank, while the West Bank itself is internally divided into eight isolated, non-contiguous regions with movement controlled by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and contractors. The requirements for obtaining a permit are supposedly set out in protocols and procedures issued by the Israeli authorities, but most are not publically available in English or Arabic. 

In 2015, there existed more than 100 different types of permits, broadly divided into the following categories: 
*Civil and political rights including permits for movement, residency, for “closed areas” such as Seam Zones, and travel. 
*Economic rights including permits for work, farming, trade and money transfer. 
*Cultural rights including permits for education, worshippers and visiting holy sites. 
*Social rights including permits for construction, renovation and health.

The issuing of permits is at the discretion of Israeli authorities, through the [Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories unit](http://www.cogat.idf.il/1026-en/IDFG.aspx), which is responsible for implementing and coordinating the Israeli government’s policies in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. COGAT is subordinate to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, meaning the Israeli Defense Forces control both policy and the enforcement of policy.
