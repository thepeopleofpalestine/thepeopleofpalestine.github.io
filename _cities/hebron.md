synopsis: |
    Hebron is a Palestinian city, population ~ 250 000, located in the south of the West Bank. The city exists under difficult circumstances as a microcosm of the larger occupation. For Palestinians, there is limitted ability to move freely as soldiers control all movement through checkpoints and barriers, while settlers occupy the heart of the city.

### Background

Hebron, a Palestinian city of ~250 000 people, is a microcosm of the occupation, particularily when looking at the ability for Palestinians to move about. Hebron is located in the south of the West Bank, and is surrounded by settlements; and in fact, some 800 settlers occupy certain places in the old city of Herbon. The situation is consistently tense, but life goes on for Palestinians. Hebron has a university, sports stadiums, is the industrial engine of the Palestinian economy and remains a major center for commerce and trade.

In October 1998, the Wye River memorandum was signed, which established conditions whereby Israeli soldiers would remain in the city center, part of Area A, from which they should have "redeployed" years prior in accordance with the Oslo accords. To this day, soldiers, Jewish settlers, checkpoints and barriers remain a fixture in Hebron. Freedom of movement for Palestinians is more restricted in Hebron than anywhere else in the West Bank. The city is broken down into H1 and H2 areas; in H1 a short (150m) walk from the market to home [can take hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP4xS_7wLyM). [Entire streets are appropriated](https://www.hebronapartheid.org/index.php?page=map) by the Israeli military and areas are closed to only Palestinians. [Jewish settlers invade and occupy Palestinian](https://palsolidarity.org/2016/02/ongoing-colonization-in-hebron-israeli-forces-prepare-the-illegal-invasion-of-palestinian-houses-by-israeli-settlers/) homes, while Israeli soldiers watch and protect the settlers. And this treatement extends to children as well: [Palestinian children are harassed and beaten](pdf from assets) by Jewish Israeli settlers on the way to school. 

The structures and systems which restrict the ability to move about freely in the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt or Palestine) is one of the most prominent features of the Israeli occupation. Movement, for Palestinians, is restricted  through a complex system of administrative measures (e.g. prohibited roads, permit requirements, age restrictions) and physical constraints (e.g. checkpoints, roadblocks, the wall). Every day, in order to move anywhere beyond their immediate residential area, Palestinians must pass through through checkpoints manned by Israeli soldiers, take significant detours because of roads that are closed to Palestinians, present ID cards and permits or attempt to navigate a variety of other obstacles. The extent and pervasiveness of impediments to free movement is difficult to explain as we, as human beings, tend to process and evaluate new information based on our known experiences. This process, known as heuristic, makes it difficult to truly grasp the effect that severe limitations on movement can have on an individual or society. One analogy - a common heuristic - to provide readers in North America with a frame of reference (unless you've been to prison) for the way everyday movement is restricted in the West Bank: there are more impediments to pass beyond for a 10 year old girl walking to school in Hebron than there are for a middle aged man accessing a ship on a naval base in Canada.  

The system of movement restrictions that Israel has implemented discriminates against all Palestinians. Some Palestinians are almost certain to be denied permits or harrassed at checkpoints, but no Palestinian is guarenteed free and unimpeded movement. It does not matter whether it is the Palestinian Authority President or a farmer trying to get to his field, every Palestinian is subject to Israel's system of restrictions. This ensures that every trip, large or small involves a degree of uncertainty that make it very difficult to manage a schedule; for many people travel becomes such an onerous undertaking that Palestinians who can avoid travelling, don't travel. To be absolutely clear, movement restrictions extend to all Palestinians. It may sound unfathomable but there are many examples where medical staff and first responders are held up at checkpoints while attempting to render assistance to sick, birthing or injured people. 

Although foreigners who seek to visit, work or immigrate to Palestine are less restricted in their ability to travel to, or within, the West Bank (Gaza is completely off-limits), they are not immune to Israel's restriction of movements. Internationals must pass through checkpoints, around barriers, show identification, and can be denied access, and/or banned from re-entry for 10 years, if the Israeli administration takes issue with the purpose of the visit. There are countless examples where internationals are prevented entry to Israel - thus preventing access to Palestine - by Israeli authorities: the [UN Rapporteur for Israel](http://972mag.com/how-to-foil-a-human-rights-probe-keep-the-investigator-out/115600/), [Foreign Ministers](https://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=770681), [academics](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/noam-chomsky-denied-entry-into-israel-and-west-bank-1.290701), or [NGO and humanitarian workers](https://electronicintifada.net/content/why-does-israel-feel-threatened-humanitarian-workers/13192). These examples are simply illustrations of how deliberate Israel is in controlling the images and information, available to global citizens. 

**_Administrative system of control_**: The foundation for the control of movement is the “permit system.” In May 2002, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) cancelled the “general exit permit” and since then, Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation have been required to have written permission (from Israel) to move between, and within, the occupied Palestinian territories. Under this system, virtually no one is permitted to enter or leave Gaza, less than 10% of Palestinians can leave the West Bank, while the West Bank itself is internally divided into eight isolated, non-contiguous regions with movement controlled by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and contractors. The requirements for obtaining a permit are supposedly set out in protocols and procedures issued by the Israeli authorities, but many are not publically available in English or Arabic. 

In 2015, there existed more than 100 different types of permits, broadly divided into the following categories: 

* Civil and political -  including permits for movement, residency, for “closed areas” such as Seam Zones, and travel. 
* Economic -  including permits for work, farming, trade and money transfer. 
* Cultural - including permits for education, worshippers and visiting holy sites. 
* Social - including permits for construction, renovation and health.

The issuing of permits is at the discretion of Israeli authorities, through the [Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories unit](http://www.cogat.idf.il/1026-en/IDFG.aspx), which is responsible for implementing and coordinating the Israeli government’s policies in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. COGAT is subordinate to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, meaning the Israeli Defense Forces control both policy and the enforcement of policy. 

**_Physical system of control_**: Physical movement of Palestinians is controlled via physical obstructions inside the West Bank, including checkpoints, gates, dirt mounds, concrete blocks placed in roads, trenches and the wall. Palestinian traffic is funnelled onto secondary and often lower-quality routes, or blocked altogether. According to the 1993 Oslo Interim Agreement – which should have led to final status negotiations in 1999 - the movement of people and vehicles in the West Bank should “without derogating from Israel’s security powers and responsibilities, be free and normal, and shall not need to be effected through checkpoints or roadblocks.” Furthermore, it is recognized that the West Bank and Gaza should be maintained as a “single territorial unit … respecting and preserving without obstacles, normal and smooth movement of people.” The reality, specifically relating to movement, is far worse for Palestinians today than it was before the Oslo accords. 

In 2015, according to the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, there were <a href="/assets/cities/hebron/490percentofclosures.jpg" target="_blank">490 permanent or semi-permanent</a> 
closures.

### Israeli narrative

Many justifications have been offered for certain aspects of the occupation, but the restriction on movement is a topic Israeli politicians attempt to avoid. When pressed, the Israeli spokepersons have indicated that a comprehensive system of restrictions on freedom of movement within the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem is a **temporary measure to contain violent confrontations with its military and to protect Israeli citizens**, in both Israel and the West Bank, from attacks by Palestinians. These restrictions came in addition to pre-existing policies which restricted the access of Palestinians to large and important areas, such as East Jerusalem, areas designated as closed military zones, settler only roads and land allocated use by Israeli settlers only. Israeli Justice Asher Grunis acknowledged in 2012 that restricting movement in the manner Israel does, is a violation of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and the duties of an occupying power, but stated that [human rights are not a prescription for national suicide](http://thenational.ae/opinion/comment/how-israel-uses-its-security-needs-tojustify-discrimination). Other Israeli lawmakers and politicians have reaffirmed this position. While this may initially sound reasonable, intelligent and legal, when the situation and system is examined in greater dpeth, this position is misleading. 

#### International Law and its application to Freedom of Movement

International law allows for occupying powers to use drastic measures as required by the security situation. On the other hand, International law is also absolutely clear that this may not become the norm. Anyone who travels through the occupied Palestinian territories quickly recognizes that the current and entrenched restrictions on movement are in no way temporary nor related to security; it becomes unequivocally clear that the system of restriction is elaborate and permenant, while the intent is to make all movement difficult. In fact, Israeli officials have stated that if Palestinians don't like how difficult it is to move, Palestinians can leave. 

* 4th Geneva Convention (Art 27 & 64) - While certain restrictions on freedom of movement are allowed under international law, including for reasons of security, they must be strictly necessary for that purpose, proportionate and non-discriminatory.
* International Human Rights Law (Article 13) - (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.
* International Humanitarian Law (Rule 88, 139) - The occupying Power retains positive obligations to ensure the welfare of the population, including the provision of medical supplies. Additionally, non-discrimination is also relevant, especially in relation to the differential treatment of settlers and Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
* Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 13) & International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (12)** – Freedom of movement is a human right. The individual permit regime makes it a privilege to be granted or denied by Israeli authorities as an exception to the norm. While protection of national security may justify some restrictions in specific circumstances, the requirement that applicants meet narrowly defined criteria, such as visiting a sick relative or requiring hospital treatment, constitutes a fundamental breach. The relation between rights and restrictions must not be reversed, and freedom of movement must not be made dependent on any particular purpose or reason.


### Deconstructing the Narrative 

 According to a 2016 joint report by the [UN, EU, US and Russia](http://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/report-middle-east-quartet-july-1-2016), Israel’s system of checkpoints and permits exceed any justifiable restriction on the freedom of Palestinian movement. There are numerous analysis and reports that are very clear in stating that Israel violates it's obligation as an occupying power and International Law, by denying Palestinians basic rights, including the ability to move freely. The current system of restrictions, which has existed since the 1990s, makes it is possible to shut 500 000 people into an area by closing a few gates, roads or checkpoints, while seperating families, communities and the West Bank as a whole. The report indicates that as per International law, this would be permissible only in certain circumstances. The fact that these restrictions have existed for more than 20 years, and affect every individual, make it an infraction of basic human rights for Palestinians.
 
  Israeli occupation forces are able to limit and control any Palestinians’ movement beyond his or her immediate residential areas. Palestinians are restricted in roads they are able to access; throughout the West Bank there is a two-tiered road system: one set of roads for green license plates, while yellow license plates can go anywhere. Palestinians, who are residents of the West Bank, are issued green license plates and are prevented from using many of the main roads and highways in the West Bank. This is strictly enforced; if a Palestinian were to be caught on an Israeli-only road, the consequences would be severe. As a result, all Palestinian traffic is funnelled through specific choke points, allowing Israeli forces to completely control how, where and when Palestinians travel. Additionally, checkpoints, barriers, pop-up checkpoints, and other physical impediments create a situation of constant uncertainty for Palestinians in their efforts to carry out everyday activities, such as attending university, visiting a doctor, marketing farm produce or returning to their home. Unpredictable, random checkpoints often appear; soldiers choose to allow some people to pass, while others wait. In other circumstances, Palestinians can't secure permission (through a permit) to travel outside of the West Bank. Palestinians must ask for permission to visit the Mediterranean sea or Haifa or Jerusalem, and only receive permits on special occassions. It is clear that these impediments have been normalized by the Israeli occupation. 
 
How, then, is Israel able create, sustain, and justify such apartheid policies? This question is not easy to answer, and requires a comprehensive understanding of the sitution and power imbalance. Most commonly, however, Jewish Israelis and foreigners who haven’t been to the West Bank, and are unfamiliar with the restrictions and segregation, accept the security narrative. But the security justification doesn't add up. It is not legally justified nor does it improve security; the overwhelming majority of Palestinians present no physical threat to Israel. All good entering Palestinian terretories are strictly controlled by Israel, and Israel maintains complete military superiority. Furthermore, the restrictions on movement antagonize every Palestinian, rather than dissuade a few who seek to harm Israel. The restriction on movement is a major grievance for every Palestinian against Israel. People just want to be able to travel within their state without the threat of road blocks, intentional delays or humiliating searches. So while every attack by a Palestinian is portrayed as terrorism - and if they are attacking civilians, it fits the description of terrorism - the motivation for the attack bears questioning. If every assailant states that their motivation is rooted in the occupation - the endless checkpoints, the restrictions on travel, the violent settlers and the friends who have been shot by soldiers at non-violent demonstrations, continued oppression under the auspices of "security" don't make sense. The justification only placates those who have never witnessed the systematic oppression. Yes, Israelis should not die needlessly, but nor should Palestinians. 

 Israel has ignored International Law and the Geneva Conventions, and implemented a system of laws that serve to discriminate against Palestinians, while concealing the State’s intolerance for, and oppression of, Palestinians behind the screen of “security.” Through the creation of a two-tiered or apartheid state where ethno-national status determines freedom, Palestinians cannot access their farmland, families, medical services, schools, or other essential elements of their livelihoods. And yet, more than 2 million Palestinians access Israel every day, either because they have permits or because they live in Israel. Palestinians, as any human being would, despise the permit system, and restrictions on movement as it only serves to make every Palestinians journey difficult - sometimes deadly. Israel is able to sustain such apartheid policies because Israeli politicians, Israeli citizens and the rest of the world either do not have an understanding of the current situation, or do not feel responsible to hold Israel accountable to its international legal and treaty commitments, and alleged democratic standards. The true motivation behind Israeli policies appears to be the creation of conditions so terrible, that Palestinians will leave. The restrictions on movement are a serious hardship, and fit within the intent of Israel to take all of the Palestinians land. 



**Example 1**: As per the case study, there a numerous cases, documented by the World Health Organization, where cancer patients died because they weren't issued permits to access places with proper medical facilities. Cancer treatment cannot be a security issue. Permit policies are illegal and immoral, used as a tool to oppress and marginalize a population, under the pretence of security.  but in fact violate basic human rights, international law and simply remove the value of a human life and dignity.

**Example 2**: The West Bank is effectively divided into 8 sections, through a complex system checkpoints that funnel all Palestinian traffic through chokepoints. Any travel involves passing through multiple checkpoints where line-ups can last hours or there can be no delay at all. The experience proceeding through a checkpoint is different every time, largely dependent on the mood, personality and demeanour of the soldiers. No Palestinian person or entity is exempt from this system. As a result, many Palestinians cannot access medical services, or medical practitioners cannot access patients, without passing through an Israeli checkpoint. The World Health Organization documented that at least 71 cases where women gave birth at check-points between 2000 to 2006. More than 35 of the newborns did not survive as emergency medical services were prevented from accessing [birthing mothers](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/checkpoint-births) or [dying children](https://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/special-topics/checkpoints/). These avoidable deaths at Israeli checkpoints are in contravention of Convention (IV) Art. 16 which states: “The wounded and sick, as well as the infirm, and expectant mothers, shall be the object of particular protection and respect.” https://www.ochaopt.org/documents/annual_humanitarian_overview_2014_english_final.pdf

**Example 3**: The [two-tiered road system](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/segregated-roads-west-bank), and other policies which dictate where Palestinians are permitted reflect blatant discrimination based on ethno-national origin since these restrictions apply only to Palestinians, akin to apartheid policies in South Africa. Israeli citizens and foreign nationals travel freely along direct and well-maintained roads throughout the West Bank. A 15-minute trip (7.4km) from Bethlehem to Jerusalem takes any Israeli 15 minutes with a “false” checkpoint, whereas the same trip would require every Palestinian (construction worker, doctor and PA President alike) to pass through Checkpoint 300 – a checkpoint used by every Palestinian and known for queues that can last hours. These policies bear stark resemblance to South African Pass laws, repealed in 1987.

**Example 4**: [Families are separated indefinitely](http://www.btselem.org/video/2008/09/israel-splits-families-between-gaza-and-west-bank) because they cannot obtain permission to live together.
