### Background

The structures and systems which take away the ability to move about freely in the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt or Palestine) is one of the most prominent features of the Israeli occupation. _There is no debate about whether it is an occupation. It has been an Israeli occupation since 1967, and no informed individual disputes that fact_. Movement, for Palestinians, is restricted  through a complex system of administrative measures (e.g. prohibited roads, permit requirements, age restrictions) and physical constraints (e.g. checkpoints, roadblocks, the wall - refered to by Israelis as the seperation barrier and Palestinians as the discrimination wall). Every day, in order to move anywhere beyond their immediate residential area, Palestinians must pass through through checkpoints manned by Israeli soldiers, take significant detours because of roads that are closed to Palestinians, present ID cards and permits or attempt to navigate a variety of other obstacles . The extent and pervasiveness of impediments to free movement is difficult to explain. Human beings tend to process and evaluate new information based on their known experiences. This is known as a heuristic process - analogy is a common heuristic - but in North America we have no frame of reference (unless you've been to prison) for the way everyday movement is restricted in Palestine. To provide some form of analogy, there are more obstacles for a 10 year old girl walking to school in Hebron than there are for a middle aged man entering a military base in Canada.  

The system of movement restrictions that Israel has implemented discriminates against all Palestinians. Some Palestinians are almost certain to be denied permits or harrassed at checkpoints, but no Palestinian is guarenteed free and unimpeded movement. It does not matter whether it is the Palestinian Authority President or a farmer trying to get to his field, every Palestinian is subject to Israel's system of restrictions. This ensures that every trip, large or small involves a degree of uncertainty that make it very difficult to manage a schedule; for many people travel becomes such an onerous undertaking that Palestinians who can avoid travelling, don't travel. To be absolutely clear, movement restrictions extend to all Palestinians. It may sound unfathomable - and in contravention of the Gevena conventions - but there are many examples where medical staff and first responders who are held up at checkpoints while attempting to render assistance to sick, birthing or injured people. 

Most foreigners who seek to visit or support Palestine are less restricted in their ability to travel to, or within, the West Bank (Gaza is completely off-limits), but are not immune to Israel's restriction of movements. One of the most significant concerns for internationals is the Israeli policy where you can be denied access, and banned from re-entry for 10 years, based on Israelis issue with the purpose of the visit. Authority to enforce this policy is delegated significantly, to agents manning the borders, but doesn't involved any official deportation process. There are countless examples where internationals are prevented entry to Israel - thus preventing access to Palestine - by Israeli authorities. See the [UN Rapporteur for Israel](http://972mag.com/how-to-foil-a-human-rights-probe-keep-the-investigator-out/115600/), [Foreign Ministers](https://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=770681), [academics](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/noam-chomsky-denied-entry-into-israel-and-west-bank-1.290701), or [NGO and humanitarian workers](https://electronicintifada.net/content/why-does-israel-feel-threatened-humanitarian-workers/13192) whose experience demonstates how selective Israel is in granting access, even to Westerners. 

The situation in Hebron is particularly harrowing. Hebron is a Palestinian city of ~250 000 people, located in the south of the West Bank, very important to industry within Palestine. In October 1998, the Wye River memorandum was signed, which established conditions whereby Israeli soldiers would remain in the city center, part of Area A which they should have withdrawn from years prior in accordance with the Oslo accords. To this day, soldiers, Jewish settlers, checkpoints and barriers remain in the heart of Hebron. Freedom of movement for Palestinians is even more restricted than elsewhere in the West Bank. The city is broken down into H1 and H2 areas and in H1 a walk of 100m, from the market home [can take hours](9https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP4xS_7wLyM). [Entire streets are appropriated](https://www.hebronapartheid.org/index.php?page=map) by the Israeli military and areas are closed to only Palestinians. Even worse, [Jewish settlers invade and occupy Palestinian](https://palsolidarity.org/2016/02/ongoing-colonization-in-hebron-israeli-forces-prepare-the-illegal-invasion-of-palestinian-houses-by-israeli-settlers/) homes, while Israeli soldiers watch and protect the settlers. The inhumane treatement extends to children as [Palestinian children are harassed and beaten](pdf from assets) by Jewish Israeli settlers on the way to school. 

**_Administrative System of Control_**: The foundation for the control of movement is the “permit system.” In May 2002, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) cancelled the “general exit permit” and since then, Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation have been required to have written permission (from Israel) to move between, and within, the occupied Palestinian territories. Under this system, virtually no one is permitted to enter or leave Gaza, less than 10% of Palestinians can leave the West Bank, while the West Bank itself is internally divided into eight isolated, non-contiguous regions with movement controlled by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and contractors. The requirements for obtaining a permit are supposedly set out in protocols and procedures issued by the Israeli authorities, but most are not publically available in English or Arabic. 

In 2015, there existed more than 100 different types of permits, broadly divided into the following categories: 

* Civil and political rights including permits for movement, residency, for “closed areas” such as Seam Zones, and travel. 
* Economic rights including permits for work, farming, trade and money transfer. 
* Cultural rights including permits for education, worshippers and visiting holy sites. 
* Social rights including permits for construction, renovation and health.

The issuing of permits is at the discretion of Israeli authorities, through the [Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories unit](http://www.cogat.idf.il/1026-en/IDFG.aspx), which is responsible for implementing and coordinating the Israeli government’s policies in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. COGAT is subordinate to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, meaning the Israeli Defense Forces control both policy and the enforcement of policy. 

**_Physical System of Control_**: Physical movement of Palestinians is controlled via physical obstructions inside the West Bank, including dirt mounds, concrete blocks placed in roads, trenches and the wall. According to the 1993 Oslo Interim Agreement – which should have led to final status negotiations in 1999 - the movement of people and vehicles in the West Bank should “without derogating from Israel’s security powers and responsibilities, be free and normal, and shall not need to be effected through checkpoints or roadblocks.” Furthermore, it is recognized that the West Bank and Gaza should be maintained as a “single territorial unit … respecting and preserving without obstacles, normal and smooth movement of people.” 
This is not the reality for Palestinians, as Palestinian traffic is funnelled onto secondary and often lower-quality routes, or blocked altogether.

In 2015 there were <a href="/assets/cities/hebron/490percentofclosures.jpg" target="_blank">490 permanent or semi-permanent</a> 
closures.

### Israeli Narrative

The Israeli authorities have indicated that a comprehensive system of restrictions of freedom of movement within the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem is a **temporary measure to contain violent confrontations with its military and to protect Israeli citizens**, both in Israel and in the West Bank, from attacks by Palestinians. These restrictions came in addition to pre-existing policies which restricted the access of Palestinians to large and important areas, such as East Jerusalem, areas designated as closed military zones, settler only roads and land allocated use by Israeli settlers only. Israeli Justice Asher Grunis acknowledged in 2012 that restricting movement in the manner Israel does, is a violation of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and the duties of an occupying power, but stated that [human rights are not a prescription for national suicide](www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/how-israel-uses-its-security-needs-tojustify-discrimination). Other Israeli lawmakers and politicians have reaffirmed this position. While this may initially sound reasonable and intelligent, such a position must be examined in greater detail. 

International law allows for occupying powers to use drastic measures as required by the security situation. On the other hand, International law is also absolutely clear that this may not become the norm. Anyone who travels through the occupied Palestinian territories will quickly recognize that the currents restrictions of movement are in no way related to security; it becomes unequivocally clear that the intent is to make travel and movement difficult. In fact, Israeli officials have stated that this is in an effort to coerce Palestinians to leave. Furthermore, the humiliating treatment Palestinians suffer at the hands of Israeli soldiers at checkpoints only creates more grievances against Israel. 

#### International Law and its Application to Freedom of Movement

* 4th Geneva Convention (Art 27 & 64)** - While certain restrictions on freedom of movement are allowed under international law, including for reasons of security, they must be strictly necessary for that purpose, proportionate and non-discriminatory.
* International Human Rights Law (Article 13)** - (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.
* International Humanitarian Law (Rule 88, 139)** - The occupying Power retains positive obligations to ensure the welfare of the population, including the provision of medical supplies. Additionally, non-discrimination is also relevant, especially in relation to the differential treatment of settlers and Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
* Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 13) & International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (12)** – Freedom of movement is a human right, yet the individual permit regime makes it a privilege to be granted or denied by Israeli authorities as an exception to the norm. While protection of national security may justify some restrictions in specific circumstances, the requirement that applicants meet narrowly defined criteria, such as visiting a sick relative or requiring hospital treatment, constitutes a fundamental breach. The relation between rights and restrictions must not be reversed, and freedom of movement must not be made dependent on any particular purpose or reason.


### Deconstructing the Narrative 

Imagine being able to shut 500 000 people into one area, by closing one gate. This is the situation the West Bank. According to a 2016 joint report by the [UN, EU, US and Russia](http://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/report-middle-east-quartet-july-1-2016), Israel’s system of checkpoints and permits exceeds any justifiable restriction on the freedom of Palestinian movement. Israeli authorities are able to limit and control any Palestinians’ movement beyond his or her immediate residential areas. Checkpoints, barriers, pop-up checkpoints, and other physical impediments create a situation of constant uncertainty for Palestinians regarding their ability to carry out everyday activities, such as returning home, going to work or school in the nearby town, or marketing farm produce. It is virtually impossible to plan when random checkpoints appear, or soldiers arbitrarily decide to allow some people to pass, while others wait. 

Palestinians are restricted in roads they are able to access; throughout the West Bank there is a two-tiered road system: one set of roads for green license plates, while yellow license plates can go anywhere. Palestinians, who are residents of the West Bank, are issued green license plates and are prevented from using many of the main roads and highways in the West Bank. This is strictly enforced; if a Palestinian were to be caught on a Jewish-only road, the consequences would be severe, ranging from prison time to death. As a result, all Palestinian traffic is funnelled through specific choke points, allowing Israeli forces to completely control how, where and when Palestinians travel. 

How, then, is Israel able create, sustain, and justify such apartheid policies? While conducting interviews in 2016, a few justifications were offered by Jewish Israelis for the excessive restrictions. From soldiers we often heard: “there is a place for Jews and a place for the Muslims.” From settlers: “security.” Most commonly, however, Jewish Israelis and foreigners who hadn’t been to the West Bank were unfamiliar with the restrictions and segregation. Israel has ignored International Law and the Geneva conventions, and implemented a system of laws that serve to discriminate against Palestinians, while concealing the State’s intolerance and oppression of Palestinians behind the screen of “security.” Israel has created a two-tiered or apartheid state where ethno-national status determines freedom. When Palestinians can’t access their farmland, families, medical services, school or other essential elements of their livelihoods, that has nothing to do with security. More than 2 million Palestinians access Israel every day, whether because they have permits, or because they live in Israel. The permit system, and restrictions on movement only serve to make every Palestinians journey more difficult - sometimes deadly - and cannot be explained away through the word security or terrorism. The only reason Israel is able to sustain its apartheid policies is because Israeli politicians, Israeli citizens and the rest of the world either don’t know, or don’t want to hold Israel accountable to its International legal and treaty commitments, and alleged democratic standards. 

**Example 1**: [Cancer patients have died because they haven’t received permits to access to medical facilities](pdf from assets - Gaza cancer patient). Cancer treatment cannot be a security issue. Permit policies are used as a tool to oppress and marginalize a population, under the pretence of security, but in fact violate basic human rights, international law and simply remove the value of a human life and dignity.

**Example 2**: The West Bank is effectively divided into 8 sections, through a complex system checkpoints that funnel all Palestinian traffic through chokepoints. Any travel involves passing through multiple checkpoints where line-ups can last hours or there can be no delay at all. The experience proceeding through a checkpoint is different every time, largely dependent on the mood, personality and demeanour of the soldiers. No Palestinian person or entity is exempt from this system. The means for many Palestinians, they cannot access a hospital without passing an Israeli checkpoint. As a result, there are hundreds of examples – documented by the World Health Organization - where emergency medical services have been prevented from accessing [birthing mothers](https://www.ochaopt.org/documents/annual_humanitarian_overview_2014_english_final.pdf) or [dying children](https://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/special-topics/checkpoints/). Feature film Inch’Allah demonstrates how detrimental this inhumane practice can be. 

**Example 3**: The [two-tiered road system](http://visualizingpalestine.org/visuals/segregated-roads-west-bank) allows Israeli citizens and foreign nationals travel freely along direct and well-maintained roads throughout the West Bank. A 15-minute trip (7.4km) from Bethlehem to Jerusalem takes any Israeli 15 minutes with a “false” checkpoint, whereas the same trip would require every Palestinian (construction worker, doctor and PA President alike) to pass through Checkpoint 300 – a checkpoint used by every Palestinian and known for queues that can last hours. 
 
**Example 4**: Israel's policies reflect blatant discrimination based on ethno-national origin since these restrictions apply only to Palestinians, akin to apartheid policies in [South Africa](pdf from assets - South African pass laws). 

**Example 5**: [Families are separated indefinitely](http://www.btselem.org/video/2008/09/israel-splits-families-between-gaza-and-west-bank) because they cannot obtain permission to live together.
