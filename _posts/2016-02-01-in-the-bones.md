I remember an elder telling me to step gently on the earth. The reasoning behind his statement is that the earth is covered in a layer of the bones of the ancestors. Our history is in our bones, in the earth, it is as much a part of our makeup as our DNA.

Dr. Ramzy Baroud said the same to me of Palestinians. To share a story of a Palestinian without the connection to the Nakba, or the ongoing occupation is impossible. There is no way to share life as a Palestinian without describing how the Nakba has influenced the course of their lives. 

So naturally, when I wanted to share human stories about the lives of Palestinians with people who would otherwise only get media reports, which are problematic in many ways, I realized that it would be impossible to do without connecting their history to the ongoing Nakba. We then concluded as a team that this site would not be useful to effect change or even the possibility of change in the minds of people outside of this region without some data to support the stories. This is how the site and our project has evolved. We want people to connect on a human level. But sometimes what happens here seems so absurd it is hard to believe what people tell you about their realities. So we've spent a lot of time on collecting data to help explain how things are the way they are. 

The story of Palestine is in my bones now too. Not only have I connected with people here in a meaningful way, but I've begun to understand why I walk lightly on this earth. Every street and every tree that is still rooted to this land has a story. And each of these stories teaches me about resilience, strength, and most importantly, hope.
